I'm passionate about technology! I had my first contact with information technology at the age of 4 and since then I've been discovering a little more about this wonderful area, I like the opportunity that technology offers people, and the proposal to make people's lives easier, I have a dream of getting to know the whole world sharing all my knowledge and also acquiring new experiences, I think knowledge is something that everyone should have access to, and I wanted to experience living in the United States for a while.

I have knowledge in: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, GIT, VBA and Windows.

I want to work outside Brazil, improve my English and get to know new cultures, people and have new experiences, currently I also study computer science and I dedicate myself to becoming a full-stack developer
